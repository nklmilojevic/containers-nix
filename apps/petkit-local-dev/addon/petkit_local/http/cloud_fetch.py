"""Asking PetKit a question as one of our devices would ask it.

Everywhere else in this package the traffic runs the other way: a device asks
us, and `http/proxy.py` may relay that exact request onward. Nothing here
relays anything — this builds a request of our own, signs it the way the
firmware signs its own, and sends it because somebody pressed a button.

The signature is not reverse-engineered guesswork. T4 firmware 1.652 carries
the two format strings side by side, in the function that builds the header::

    id%snonce%stimestamp%utype%s%s
    id=%s&nonce=%s&timestamp=%u&type=%s&sign=%s

The first is the string that goes into MD5 — the four fields concatenated with
their own names and no separators, with the signing secret appended — and the
second is the header. `signature` below is those two lines and nothing else.

Two fields must come from the device rather than from us, and both are why
`Device` records them instead of deriving them:

* `secret` is `Device.signing_secret`. Ours is accepted only by us; PetKit
  answers `{"error": {"code": 704}}` to a signature made with a secret it does
  not know. A real one is learned from a proxied `dev_signup`, or by asking for
  one here (`signup`).
* `type` is `Device.wire_type`, the spelling the firmware itself uses. It is
  hashed, so `T5` and `t5` are different requests and only one authenticates.

What this is NOT allowed to become: a poller. Every call here is a button in
the panel. The add-on talking to PetKit on its own schedule is the thing proxy
mode already avoids by only ever relaying what a device sent anyway.
