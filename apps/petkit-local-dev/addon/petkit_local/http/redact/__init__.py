"""What a proxied cloud response is allowed to contain by the time a device sees it.

Proxy mode forwards everything, so the upstream — PetKit's real cloud — gets to
put a body in front of firmware we are meant to be shielding. This module is the
one place that decides what survives that trip.

**Content-keyed, not endpoint-keyed.** There is deliberately no list of "safe
endpoints": every rule matches on the SHAPE of a decoded object wherever it
appears, so an `apiServers` block returned from an endpoint nobody expected it
on is caught anyway. The walker also descends into JSON encoded as a *string*,
which is how the heartbeat carries its commands — a rule that matched only
decoded objects would never see them.

Two very different kinds of rule live here, and the difference is what
`BLOCKING_RULES` encodes:

* **Routine substitutions** (`server`, `mqtt`, `oss_sts`, `locale`) replace the
  cloud's address — or the device's own local-time settings — with ours. They
  fire constantly, on every `dev_serverinfo` and `dev_device_info` poll, and
  mean nothing except "proxy mode is on". They are logged, not persisted.
* **Blocked attempts** (`rce`, `ota`, `secret`) mean the upstream tried to run a
  command, push firmware, or re-credential the device. These are rare, and each
  one is persisted (`events/models.py::BlockedAttempt`).

The values every substitution uses come from `payloads.to_*` — the same functions
that build our own responses — so a redacted body cannot drift from the body the
local handler would have produced.

This file holds the models and the two entry points; `rules.py` holds the rules
and the constants that name them, and `walker.py` the descent that carries them
to every object in a body. Both import back from here, so the models below are
defined before either is imported.
