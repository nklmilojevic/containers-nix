"""The one place a device request is logged, mirrored, captured and counted live.

Outermost of the three, so what it records is what the device actually received
— including whatever `proxy_middleware` substituted. Device liveness is stamped
here for the same reason: *any* HTTP contact proves the device is up, and not
every model does MQTT or even an HTTP heartbeat.

The module is named for what it does; `import logging` anywhere in this package
still reaches the stdlib, because every import in this codebase is absolute and
Python 3 has no implicit relative imports.
