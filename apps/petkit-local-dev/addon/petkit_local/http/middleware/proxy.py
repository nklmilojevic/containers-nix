#: Endpoints whose answer describes OUR state, not the cloud's. They are still
#: forwarded — the upstream reply is recorded and captured, which is the point of
#: proxy mode — but the device is always served ours.
#:
#: `dev_ble_device` lists the accessories WE have paired (`devices/ble/`); the
#: cloud's list is PetKit's, which for a taken-over device is empty. Serving the
#: cloud's answer is therefore always wrong — it would tell the device to forget
#: every accessory paired here — which is reason enough for this entry.
#:
#: It is NOT here because an empty `list` crashes the parent. The firmware's own
#: log shows:
#:
#:     res data :{"result": {"list": [], "nextTick": 3600}}
#:     [ble_relay_network.c]:[95][pk_schmg_parse_ble_dev_list]relay list prase, update:0
#:     E/ctrl [ble_relay_network.c]:[108][pk_schmg_parse_ble_dev_list]ERR:...parse item NULL
#:
#: which reads like an empty list walking into a null dereference that aborts the
#: boot chain — but PetKit's own cloud answers exactly that payload to a device
#: with no accessories, 234 times in one captured session, so the ERR line is a
#: logged parse error rather than an aborted boot. Whether WE send the empty
#: array is a separate and still unsettled question, argued out in
#: `handlers/ble_device.py`; this entry stands on the paragraph above either way.
#:
#: This set is for answers that would BREAK the device, not for answers that
#: are merely inconvenient to us. `dev_discern_pic` is deliberately absent: the
#: cloud's pets and face photos reaching the device is what proxy mode MEANS.
#: Turn proxy off to have our own pets take effect.
LOCAL_ONLY_ENDPOINTS = frozenset({"dev_ble_device"})

#: Endpoints whose REQUEST is the leak, withheld while the log-upload guard is
#: on and forwarded normally when it is off.
#:
#: `dev_upload_file_info_v2` is how the device says what it just uploaded:
#: `fileId`, `moduleType`, the AES IV, the `eventId` and the
#: pet/clean/toilet flags. Forwarded, that is a running account of what happened
#: in somebody's home — every visit, every recording, timestamped — sent to
#: PetKit by a device its owner has taken off PetKit. The media itself never
#: reaches them — it is PUT to our bucket — which makes this metadata the whole
#: of what they would learn, and it is enough.
#:
#: Redaction cannot help: it rewrites response bodies, and by the time there is
#: a body to rewrite the request has been delivered. So this is a request-side
#: gate, exactly like `_reports_a_local_log_upload` below and for the same
#: reason. It is NOT in `LOCAL_ONLY_ENDPOINTS`, because that would put it out of
#: proxy mode's reach permanently; switching the guard off proxies it again.

    Off, this is a pure pass-through with no measurable cost — the config flag is
    read from the same dict the panel mutates, so the mode flips live.

    On, the local handler still runs FIRST and in full. Its response is usually
    discarded, but its side effects are not: that is what keeps the event store,
    the HA entities and the media pipeline populated while a device is being
    observed against PetKit. Five things then decide what the device receives:

    1. **A heartbeat carrying a queued command is answered immediately, without
       forwarding at all.** Building that answer already drained the queue
       (`devices/base.py::pop_commands` is destructive and at-most-once), so any
       await between the pop and the send is a window in which the command can
       be lost — to a cancelled request, a slow upstream, or an exception. There
       is no way to put it back. The next heartbeat is ~15s away and almost
       always idle, so the observation this costs is nil.
    2. An unidentified request is never forwarded. Redaction substitutes OUR
       credentials and addresses into the reply, and without a registered device
       there is nothing to substitute — forwarding raw would be the one way this
       middleware could hand a device someone else's cloud.
    3. `forward` returning None (unreachable, too slow, breaker open) falls back
       to the local response. A device must never pay for PetKit being down.
    4. An upstream reply the device could not act on falls back to the local
       response too — a non-2xx, OR a 200 carrying PetKit's refusal envelope
       (`{"error": {"code": 704}}`, which is what a taken-over device gets on
       every session-bearing endpoint, since the session it presents is one WE
       issued). Relaying either breaks the never-404 rule from the far side:
       observed on real hardware, a `dev_serverinfo` with no server list puts the
       device into a boot loop every ~2.4s. The status, the error and the body
       are all still recorded — observing the refusal is the point, showing it to
       the device is not.
    5. Anything else is answered with the redacted upstream reply. A heartbeat
       that got this far was idle, so merging is a no-op on our side and simply
       lets the cloud's commands through.

    Everything after the local handler is wrapped: a failure in forwarding,
    redaction or recording answers with the local response rather than letting a
    500 reach a device that is waiting for one.
