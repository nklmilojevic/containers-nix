"""dev_state_report — the device's periodic full state dump.

Every ~30 seconds (the `interval` this handler hands back) a device posts
everything it knows about itself: work state, error flags, WiFi, consumable
levels. That single payload is what almost every Home Assistant sensor in this
project is ultimately rendered from, so the handler's job is to get it parsed
and into `device.state` — nothing here talks back to the device beyond the
poll interval and a timestamp.

The body is deliberately parsed defensively. It arrives as
`state=<JSON>` form-urlencoded, sometimes gzip-compressed, sometimes
percent-encoded, and on some models as a bare JSON body; a shape we fail to
recognise must degrade to "no state this round" rather than to an error status,
because a device whose state report 500s just retries the same body forever.

    T5 sends, identical to the MQTT property post) — which one applies depends on
    the model, and applying both costs nothing while covering either.

    Fires the app's ``on_state_report`` callback, which is what pushes the new

    its report is parsed only far enough to mirror onto the panel.
