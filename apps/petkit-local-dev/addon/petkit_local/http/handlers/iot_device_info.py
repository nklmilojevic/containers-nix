"""dev_iot_device_info / dev_only_iot_device_info[_v2] — MQTT credentials.

The second of the two handlers that may CREATE a registry entry (the other is
signup): a device that was provisioned before this server existed asks for its
credentials without ever signing up again, and answering "unknown device" would
leave it with no way to reach the broker.

    address it can reach on its own.

    Takes the config rather than the request because proxy mode's redaction
    policy needs the same answer with no request in hand, and the two must not
    be able to disagree: redaction rewrites the upstream cloud's broker address
    to whatever this returns, so a second derivation that drifted would hand a
    device an address it is not listening on.

    Returns:
        The hostname, or "" when `api_url` has none to give. Empty is a working
        outcome, not a failure — the device then falls back to the HTTP
        heartbeat, which is slower but needs no broker.
