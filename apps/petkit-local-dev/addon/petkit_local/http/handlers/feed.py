"""dev_feed_get — the feeder's scheduled meals.

A feeder dispenses on its own clock, from the schedule it fetches here; the
server is not in the loop at feeding time. So the answer must always be a
well-formed schedule — an unidentified device gets an empty-but-valid one rather
than an error, which leaves it dispensing nothing instead of retrying forever.

Everything below matches 21 real cloud responses captured from a D4SH on
2026-08-12 (proxy capture, `proxy_http.jsonl`):

* Meal times — ``t`` in ``schedule[].it[]`` — are SECONDS since local midnight
  (``n_46560`` fires at 12:56:00), not the minutes every other schedule on
  these devices counts. The ``n_`` id suffix is that same seconds value.
* ``latest[]`` lists the concrete feeds firing TODAY OR TOMORROW (local days),
  nothing further out: a Sunday meal polled on Wednesday is in ``schedule``
  but never in ``latest``. Each entry's ``t`` is a live countdown — seconds
  from now, floored, recomputed on every poll. Ids: ``s_YYYYMMDD_SSSSS`` is a
  concrete instance of a recurring meal (suffix = the meal's ``t``),
  ``d_YYYYMMDD_SSSSS`` a one-off deferred feed.
* ``nextTick`` is the countdown of the LAST ``latest`` entry — re-poll when
  the final listed feed has fired — and the constant 86340 when ``latest`` is
  empty (all five empty-schedule captures), i.e. try again in about a day.
