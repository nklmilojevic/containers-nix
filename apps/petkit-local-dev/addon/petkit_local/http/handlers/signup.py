"""dev_signup — device registration, the first call of a device's life.

A device that has just been pointed at us announces itself here, and the reply
is what convinces it that it belongs to an account and may proceed to fetch MQTT
credentials, its config and its schedules. Everything downstream assumes the
registry entry this creates.

One of the two handlers that may CREATE a registry entry (the other is
iot_device_info); `handlers/_common.py` resolves but never creates, so the
`get_or_create` below stays here.

    Amsterdam`. Both were read off the wire and thrown away, so `to_signup`
    answered with the SERVER's offset and an empty locale: a device that had
    just said it was at -4.0 was told 2.0, and one that said `en-US` was told
    nothing.

    provisioning and burns it into its video watermarks, so a reply that
