"""Proxy mode's MQTT half: a second client, connected to the real Aliyun broker.

The HTTP side of proxy mode is a middleware that forwards a request and hands
back the cloud's answer. MQTT has no request to forward — it is two long-lived
sessions — so the equivalent is a bridge: the device stays connected to OUR
broker, and everything it says is relayed upward while everything the cloud says
comes back down through the same redaction rules.

Three things make this harder than it looks, and each shapes the code below.

**The credentials the device uses are ours.** `http/handlers/iot_device_info.py`
mints the productKey/deviceName/deviceSecret triple itself, so Aliyun has never
heard of them (`mqtt/auth.py` says as much in its header). The real ones can
only be learned by PROXYING `dev_iot_device_info` and reading them out of the
upstream reply before redaction replaces them — which is what
`UpstreamCredentials` stores and what makes this module depend on proxy mode
being on for HTTP too.

**Topics carry identity.** Ours name our pk/dn, Aliyun's name the real ones, so
every relayed frame is re-addressed (`mqtt/topics.py::rewrite_topic`).

**The bridge hears its own echo.** `MQTTBridge` holds one `#` subscription, so
it sees our own downward publishes come back. The upward path is therefore an
explicit ALLOW-LIST of what a device originates; a deny-list would relay our own
relayed frames straight back up and loop forever. That allow-list filters by
topic SHAPE, so it cannot tell a device's own event from one we just relayed
down onto the same topic — which is why the DOWNWARD path refuses everything
outside the server's own direction (`_on_upstream`, and #20 for the storm that
came of not doing it).

Nothing here may affect the local broker. Every failure path — no credentials, a
refused connection, a dropped one, a frame that will not parse — leaves the
device talking to us exactly as it would with proxy mode off.

**Partly verified against hardware.** The real endpoint has now been reached:
`dev_only_iot_device_info_v2` proxied upstream yields a real instance host
(`{iotInstanceId}.mqtt.iothub.aliyuncs.com`, matching Alibaba's documented shape
for an Enterprise instance), and its TLS listener answers on 8883 — see
`build_tls_context` for what that handshake shows and why it is not verified.
Everything past the handshake is still untested: the port is an inference the
reply does not state, `securemode=2` with it, and `compute_aliyun_sign` can only
be tested against itself — a synthetic-signature tautology, the same limitation
the repo already grades for the rest of the MQTT side. A rejected CONNECT would
look exactly like the retry loop this module already logs.
