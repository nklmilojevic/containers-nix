"""Render a device event's `content` for humans, from the tables in `codes.py`.

`codes.py` holds what a field MEANS; this module decides how it READS. One
decoder serves three consumers -- the Timeline card label, the panel's Debug
view, and the HA "Device Status" sensor -- so a value can never be explained
one way in the UI and another way in an entity.

Two properties this module guarantees, both of which the Debug view depends on:

* **`decode_content` is total.** Every key present in `content` produces a row,
  including keys we have no table entry for (rendered raw, graded `unknown`).
  A firmware that starts sending a new field must become *visible*, not vanish.
* **Nothing raises.** Device input reaches here unvalidated, so every renderer
  degrades to the raw value rather than aborting a request.

What is deliberately NOT interpreted
------------------------------------
`box`, `pos`, `item_id`, `components`, `current` and `interval` are shown raw.
`ph_reason` is labelled but its VALUES are not decoded: urine pH detection was
off for the whole capture, so 5 and 4 are its "not measured" codes and a real
reading has never been seen. So is `auto_clear`, which looks boolean until you see
the value 7 it carried once. So is an integer `err`: 256 and 128 look like a
bitmask (1<<8, 1<<7) sitting next to code 7's separate `components` field, but
"looks like" is not evidence, so no bit meanings are invented.

    3. rewritten as "<trigger> <operation> <outcome>" for completion codes,
       e.g. "Manual cleaning canceled";
    4. suffixed with the failure cause whenever the device names one.

    Step 4 is not gated on ``result == 2``, unlike the implementation this
