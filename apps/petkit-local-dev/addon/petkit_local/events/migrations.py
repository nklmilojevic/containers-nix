"""Repairs run over rows that are already stored.

Every derived field on an `events` row — `event_kind`, `parent_event`,
`related_event`, `pet_ref` — is computed once at ingest time and persisted, so a
row written before a field existed, or before its event code was recognised,
keeps a wrong value that no amount of later reading fixes. A pass here
recomputes those fields from the untouched device `content` and writes back
only what actually changed, which is what makes it safe to run on every start.

Kept out of `events/store.py` on purpose: this is not persistence, it is the
normalizers in `events/normalize.py` applied a second time — to stored rows
instead of to payloads. The store arrives as an argument, and is imported here
for typing only.
