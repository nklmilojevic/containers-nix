"""PetRegistry — pet CRUD backed by EventStore's `pets`/`pet_faces` tables,
face-photo hosting for on-device facial recognition, and the dev_discern_pic
payload builder.

The panel calls these photos **mugshots**; this package and the schema call
them faces (`pet_faces`, `add_face`, `/faces/{filename}`). Same thing — the
short user-facing word and the identifier that predates it.

The device's NPU runs recognition locally; we host the reference photos
(`dev_discern_pic`) and read the result back out of an event's
`content.score_info[].id`. That id is the one we handed out — the firmware
copies it verbatim from the outer list entry (`get_update_face_score_info`) —
so no id-mapping protocol exists for a device we configured. `resolve_pet_ref`
covers the one case where it does not hold: a box still matching against faces
cached from PetKit's cloud reports that cloud's id until it re-syncs.
