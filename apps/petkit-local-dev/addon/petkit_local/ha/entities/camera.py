"""Camera entities shared by every camera-equipped device category.

Litter boxes, feeders and fountains that carry a camera all publish the same
live-view entity plus the two "latest media" entities that media/pipeline.py
updates, so these definitions live here once instead of once per category.

# Key must NOT be "camera": that collides with the "camera" on/off switch
# (settings.camera) — HA requires unique_id unique across all platforms.
# REMOVED: `camera_feed`, an MQTT camera on `petkit-local/{id}/camera`.
#
# HA's MQTT camera renders image bytes published to a topic, and nothing ever
# published to that one — verified on a live broker: `last_snapshot` carried a
# 54 KB retained JPEG while `/camera` had nothing at all. So the entity existed
# in every install and could never show anything.
#
# Filling it was considered and rejected. It would mean pulling a frame on a
# timer, and the device only emits a keyframe every ~4.3 s, so a snapshot costs
# ~5 s of streaming from hardware already sitting at 82% CPU — permanently, since
# an MQTT camera gives no signal for "somebody is looking". Live view goes
# through go2rtc instead (`media/go2rtc.py`), and the address is the
# `stream_url` sensor below.
