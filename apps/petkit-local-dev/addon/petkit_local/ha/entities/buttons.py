"""HA `button` entities for litter boxes, feeders and fountains.

A button is the one entity kind with no state: pressing it publishes its `key`
and nothing else. That key is the contract with `ha/commands.py::ALL_ACTIONS`,
which owns the actual device action codes — a button whose key has no entry
there appears in HA and does nothing but log a warning, so the two lists must
be kept in step.

`ha/categories.py` decides which of these lists a given device type gets.

#: Litter-box actions that need the camera generation's hardware.
#:
#: `light` is the illuminator: LBCommand calls 7 LIGHT and three isolated taps
#: of the app's Light action on a T6 each emitted `start_action: 7`, so two
#: independent sources agree. It sits here rather than on the shared list
#: because the illuminator is part of the camera assembly.
#:
#: Power is a SERVICE OF ITS OWN — `thing.service.power`, not `property.set`.
#: The distinction matters: two fountain buttons were removed for writing
#: `power` as a setting to a field no firmware reads, and the fix is a different
#: service, not a different field. See `ha/commands.py::_device_power`.

#: Purobot Ultra only.
#:
#: Both come from single isolated taps in the app's action sheet on a T6, and
#: neither is safe to extend to its siblings:
#:
#: * `pack_waste` sends `start_action: 8` — the value pypetkitapi calls
#:   RESET_N50_DEODOR. Those two readings cannot both be right, and the T6 one
#:   is what a controlled tap produced. This box has no N50 cartridge, so its
#:   `reset_n50` button is excluded in `ha/categories.py` and the code goes
#:   here under the name the hardware gives it.
#: * `open_sealed_door` sends `start_action: 11`. The sealed waste door is this
#:   model's hardware; on a box without one, 11 is an unknown value.

#: A Dual-Hopper only. `feed` above already dispenses from both, so these are
#: the one thing it cannot express: food from one hopper and not the other.
#: PetKit's app does exactly this, and does it through the same service rather
#: than a different one — its single-hopper feed was captured as
#: `{"amount1": 0, "amount2": 1}` (issue #2). How much each dispenses is the
#: matching `number` in `numbers.py::FEEDER_DUAL_NUMBERS`.

#: The W7H's water-treatment jobs, as `thing.service.start` actions.
#:
#: These are the only three of the twenty values its firmware accepts
#: (`codes.FOUNTAIN_W7H_START_ACTIONS`) that anything names. 1 and 5 name
#: themselves — `work_start_event_detect` gives each its own branch, log line
#: and still (`fPro_flushStart.jpeg`, `fPro_changeStart.jpeg`). 2 is on the
#: accept list but reaches that function's default branch, so "Refill" is the
#: app's word for a value the firmware only lets through; if it turns out to
#: mean something else, this is the button that is wrong.
#:
#: Deep clean is deliberately absent. The cycle exists (`ster_mode_*.aac`, the
#: `disinfectState` field, "Boil ster over result" in the log) but no accepted
#: action value can be tied to it, and it is the one job that needs a person
#: standing there with a kettle.
