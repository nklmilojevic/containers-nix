"""HAPublisher — the add-on's one connection to Home Assistant's MQTT broker.

Everything Home Assistant ever sees about a PetKit device passes through here:
retained discovery configs, retained state and availability, momentary event
entities, per-pet virtual devices, and the reverse direction — HA's writes on
`petkit-local/+/cmd/+`, routed back to the device.

Note the two distinct brokers this codebase talks to. The EMBEDDED broker
(`mqtt/broker.py`) is where the physical device connects with its Aliyun
credentials; the HA broker addressed here is usually Mosquitto in a separate
add-on. They are never the same connection, which is why a device command may
have to travel HA broker -> this class -> `mqtt/bridge.py` -> embedded broker.

The connection is treated as unreliable by design: `start()` reconnects
forever, and because a reconnect costs a full rediscovery of every entity of
every device, a single bad command must not be allowed to cause one (see
`ha/command_router.py`).
