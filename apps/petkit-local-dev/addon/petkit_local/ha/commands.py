"""Translate HA entity commands into device commands.

Routing is driven by the entity definition (its `component` and `value_path`),
not by parsing an opaque payload. Every command that should reach the device
returns ``(service_suffix, mqtt_envelope)`` — the caller publishes it to
``/sys/{pk}/{dn}/thing/service/{suffix}`` (or falls back to the heartbeat queue
if the MQTT bridge is down). This matches the reference localkit stack, which
delivers ALL real-time control over MQTT `thing/service/*` topics, not heartbeat.

- **button**  -> a named action (litter start/end, feed, …).
- **switch/number/select** -> a settings write via `property.set`, with an
  optimistic local update so the HA entity reflects it immediately.
- **text** (schedules) -> raw JSON written to device config, served by
  dev_schedule_get / dev_feed_get.

Action codes and envelopes are cross-checked against pypetkitapi `LBCommand`
and localkit `ServiceStart/End/FeedRealtime/PropertySet`.

    Returns:
        ``(service_suffix, envelope)`` for the caller to deliver to the device,
        or None when nothing needs to be sent — because the command was handled
        entirely locally (capability toggles, schedule text) or because it
        could not be routed at all (unknown action, uncoercible payload, an
        entity with no settings field). Both are logged; neither raises.
