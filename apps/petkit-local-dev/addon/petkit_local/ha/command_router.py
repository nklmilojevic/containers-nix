"""CommandRouter — the direction Home Assistant writes in.

Everything Home Assistant publishes to `petkit-local/{device_id}/cmd/{suffix}`
lands here: it is resolved to the entity that was discovered under that suffix,
turned into a device command (`ha/commands.py`), and delivered — over MQTT when
the device holds a session, else queued for its next HTTP heartbeat. A BLE
accessory has an HA identity of its own but no session at all, so its writes go
out as frames through the WiFi device that relays for it.

It publishes nothing itself. The one connection to HA's broker belongs to
`ha/publisher.py`, which owns this router, feeds it the messages off its own
subscription, and is called back for the optimistic state that keeps a control
from snapping back before the device confirms.
