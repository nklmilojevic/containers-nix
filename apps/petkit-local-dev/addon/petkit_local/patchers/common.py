#: WebSocket transcodes the browser mic to 16 kHz mono ADTS-AAC and streams it
#: to this TCP port on the device; the sink script below feeds it to the
#: firmware's own `pktool play_aac`, which owns the IMP speaker path. See
#: patchers/talk.py.
TALK_TCP_PORT = 9010
#: The sink script is installed ONCE into the patch store (persistent, like
#: dropbear) — so `talk` declares it in `files` and removal deletes it. Nothing
#: is written to /tmp at boot; only the per-connection FIFO the script makes at
#: runtime is ephemeral (named by the handler's PID).
TALK_SINK_NAME = "pktalk_sink.sh"
#: Body of that sink script. `nc -e /bin/sh <this>` runs it once per connection:
#: it makes a private FIFO, starts `pktool play_aac` reading it, and copies the
#: socket into the FIFO until the client hangs up. `$$` is the running sh's PID,
#: so concurrent connections never collide on the pipe name.
