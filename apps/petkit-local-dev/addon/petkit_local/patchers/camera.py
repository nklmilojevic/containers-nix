"""Local camera streaming patcher.

Replaces the Agora P2P client with tserver (local HTTP video streamer, port
80, zero auth) by bind-mounting one over the other, so the stock app_start.sh
line `./agora &` starts the local streamer instead. tserver reads frames from
the same POSIX shm `media` writes to, so it needs media running and nothing
else.

No binary patching and no file of ours on the device — the whole patch is one
line in the /system/app_init.sh wrapper.

**Never point Home Assistant's Generic Camera straight at the device.** HA's
`stream` component opens the URL with PyAV and `av.open()` segfaults inside
libav, killing the whole HA process. Put go2rtc in between; `STREAM_PATHS`
below records the evidence and the second reason for it.

#: What tserver serves, on port 80. Measured against a T5 on 2026-07-31:
#:
#: * `main.flv?audio=1` / `sub.flv?audio=1` — H.264 (1056² and 528²) plus AAC at
#:   16 kHz mono, verified over sustained reads both directly and through
#:   go2rtc. These are the ones to hand out.
#: * `main.ts` / `sub.ts` — dropped. They announce `sample_rate=0, channels=0`
#:   and list every stream twice, so nothing loads them. The FLV endpoints
#:   reported a valid `16000/1` every time they were sampled.
#: * The `audio` parameter is required, not optional — `sub.flv` with no query
#:   at all resets the connection.
#:
#: The PyAV segfault in the module docstring was observed twice, with and
#: without audio, so audio is not the trigger; it is not reproducible with
#: `av.open` in isolation, so it needs HA's threading context. go2rtc reads
#: this FLV and republishes clean RTSP.
#:
#: tserver also needs **seconds between connections**: opened back to back it
#: refuses the second, the same pair six seconds apart both succeed, and three
#: concurrent opens serve one and refuse two. So one long-lived reader in front
#: of it is not a nicety — it is what makes the camera usable for more than one
#: viewer.
#:
#: These are paths rather than one URL because tserver answers the same stream on
#: every path it is given: `/snapshot.jpg`, `/jpeg` and `/cgi-bin/snapshot.cgi`
#: all return `video/x-flv`. There is no still-image endpoint to point anything
#: at, which is why HA gets a URL for its own camera stack rather than an MQTT
#: camera entity fed with JPEGs.

    Gated on `state["streamAvailable"]` — the verdict of an actual probe, from

    That distinction is the point: `active_patchers` is what we recorded, and a
    factory reset or an app OTA wipes /system and the patch with it while our
    JSON still says applied. Equally, a device could be serving a stream nobody
    recorded. Publishing a URL that then refuses the connection is worse than
    publishing none — it reads as a broken camera rather than as a patch that
    was never applied.
