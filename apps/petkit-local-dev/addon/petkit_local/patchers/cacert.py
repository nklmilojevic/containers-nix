Appends the add-on's self-signed TLS certificate to the device's Mozilla CA

All patching is done server-side: download ca.crt → append our cert PEM → upload
back → bind-mount + restart cloud.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If either side is not a PEM bundle.

    Both inputs are validated because an empty `original` must not read as "the
    device has no CA bundle": that would write a /app/bin/ca.crt holding ONLY
    our certificate and leave the device unable to verify any other TLS peer.
    Every device ships a bundle (226 KB on a T5, 11 KB on a D4SH), so an empty
    read means the download failed, not that there is nothing to keep.

    Why strip-then-append rather than a blind append. Our certificate can be
    regenerated -- a new SAN, a new key -- and appending every time left the
    OLD ones in the bundle. The device's OpenSSL picks the FIRST certificate
    whose subject matches the one it was served as the trust anchor, so a
    stale copy with a different key fails verification even though the right
    certificate is also present, a few entries further down. Every certificate
    sharing our current subject is therefore removed and ours appended, leaving
    one.

    A block we cannot parse is kept, because "unreadable" must never mean
    "discard a CA". And re-applying the patch is now idempotent rather than an
    error: the second run simply replaces the copy the first one left.
