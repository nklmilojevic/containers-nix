"""go2rtc as a sidecar: the only safe way to hand a device camera to anything.

The camera patcher gets H.264 out of the device, and then nothing can consume it.
Two faults, both measured on a T5:

* **Home Assistant's Generic Camera segfaults on the FLV.** Its `stream`
  component opens the URL with PyAV and `av.open()` dies inside libav, killing
  the whole Python process — `Fatal Python error: Segmentation fault` in
  `stream/worker.py::try_open_stream`, and HA restarts. Seen twice, with audio
  and without, and NOT reproducible with `av.open` in isolation (single, looped,
  three-concurrent, or with HA's own options), so it needs HA's threading
  context. That makes it an HA/PyAV bug we cannot fix and have to route around.
* **tserver needs seconds between connections.** Opened back to back it refuses
  the second one; the same pair six seconds apart both succeed. Three concurrent
  opens serve one and refuse two. So it is a cooldown, not an alternation — and
  anything that opens a stream per viewer runs into it.

go2rtc fixes both: it reads the FLV, republishes RTSP, and holds exactly ONE
connection to the device however many consumers attach. Verified end to end,
including a 120 s soak with no reconnects.

It does not abolish the cooldown, and cannot: go2rtc drops the producer when the
last consumer leaves, so a viewer arriving immediately after another left still
lands in it and gets a 404. Measured on the deployed add-on — back-to-back opens
fail, six seconds apart all succeed. Normal viewing does not look like that, and
the alternative is holding the device streaming 24/7, which is the thing this
design exists to avoid.

It is deliberately a child process rather than a library. go2rtc is Go, it is
already the thing Home Assistant itself ships for WebRTC, and re-implementing an
RTSP server in Python to avoid one `exec` would be the worse trade.

**The device is only streamed from while someone is watching.** go2rtc dials the
producer on the first consumer and drops it when the last one leaves, which is
why this is a sidecar and not a frame pump — a device sitting at 82% CPU should
not stream 24/7 to fill a thumbnail.
