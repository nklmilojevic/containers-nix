"""Episode stitcher — concatenate a visit's video chunks into one continuous
clip.

A real T5 does NOT record one file per visit: it uploads a continuous stream
of small ~4s chunks (plus a separate low-res substream), all sharing one
`related_event`. Confirmed on-device 2026-07-22: a single toilet visit
produced 20+ separate `.ts` files. Playing "the visit" therefore means
concatenating its chunks in order.

Chunks of one category come from the same encoder with identical parameters
(verified: every `CLOUD_STORAGE` chunk is h264 1056x1056 @25fps + AAC), so
ffmpeg's concat demuxer with `-c copy` joins them losslessly and fast — no
re-encode. Chunks of DIFFERENT categories must never be mixed (the substream
is 528x528 @20fps with no audio), which is why the episode key includes the
category.

Because a successful stitch **deletes the source chunks**, the output is
verified before anything is removed: probed for a real video stream and a
plausible duration, then fully decoded (`-xerror`) to prove no frame is
corrupt. A failed verification leaves the chunks untouched and marks the
episode so it isn't retried forever.

Blocking-I/O rule for this module: everything here runs as a background task
on the single event loop shared with the HTTP server and the MQTT bridge, so
work whose cost scales with the number of chunks — stat'ing an episode's
chunk list, writing the concat list, unlinking the sources — is handed to
`asyncio.to_thread` in ONE batch per step, never one hop per file. Fixed-cost
single syscalls (one `unlink`, one `mkdir -p`) stay inline: the hop would cost
more than the call.
