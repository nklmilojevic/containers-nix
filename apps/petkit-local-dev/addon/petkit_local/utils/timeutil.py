"""Local-time helpers: what "today" means, and what offset to tell a device.

Everything in this codebase stores UTC epochs, and that is correct -- the
devices report correct UTC and nothing here changes that. The bug this module
exists to fix is one layer up: a *day* was being cut at UTC midnight while the
box sits in someone's house. On a UTC+2 install that files every event between
local midnight and 02:00 under the previous day, which measured out at 50 of
268 events in the reference corpus, including six complete after-midnight
toilet visits.

Where "local" comes from
------------------------
The Supervisor sets the add-on container's timezone from Home Assistant's own
configuration (`TZ=Europe/Warsaw` on the reference install), so the process
already knows. `datetime.astimezone()` on a NAIVE datetime interprets it as
local wall-clock time and attaches the offset that was in force *on that date*
-- which is what makes the DST handling below work without a tz database
dependency or a configured zone name.

    is unambiguous, and — unlike an offset frozen at provisioning — it moves
    with DST, so it is right in both halves of the year. A device that only ever
    got a locale and never a numeric offset reports the offset as 0, which is
    how a box plainly in `Europe/Warsaw` ends up telling us it is in UTC; this
    recovers the real offset from the name it did send.
