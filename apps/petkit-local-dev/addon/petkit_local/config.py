"""Runtime configuration: add-on options, panel overrides and their defaults.

The add-on runs on a plain Python base image with no bashio and no s6-overlay,
so everything the HA supervisor would normally inject has to be read here
instead: `/data/options.json`, the host's LAN IP and the Mosquitto credentials
all come from the Supervisor API. Every read degrades — a missing, damaged or
mistyped option logs and keeps the default, because the add-on failing to start
takes the devices offline with it, while a wrong option only degrades one
feature. The one exception is an explicit `--config` file, which raises.
