# A K3 Pura Air spray or W5 fountain has no network identity: it is reached over BLE
# by a mains-powered neighbour that relays for it. The device does NOT discover
# accessories — it pulls a list from the cloud (`dev_ble_device`) and scans for
# exactly those MACs, and no firmware in any of the three we have examined has
# an endpoint for reporting a newly-found one upward. Pairing happens in
# PetKit's app, which is to say in the cloud; since we ARE the cloud, pairing
# has to be entered here. That is why this is a form and not a discovery scan.


#: Accessory ids are allocated from here up. Deliberately far above the 8-digit
#: ids PetKit issues real devices, so a generated one cannot be mistaken for a
#: real device id and cannot collide with one that registers later.
