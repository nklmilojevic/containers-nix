"""The wire bodies a device is served: one function per device-facing endpoint.

A device never sees our data structures — it sees JSON bodies on a handful of
device-facing HTTP endpoints, and the firmware is unforgiving about their exact
shape (see `to_signup` and `to_oss_sts`, whose comments record what was learned
the hard way). Every one of those bodies is generated here, next to the state it
is built from, so a field's type cannot drift between the HTTP handler that
serves it and the MQTT service reply that mirrors it.

The `to_*` functions generate the response bodies for the device-facing
endpoints, `{"result": ...}` wrapper included, so a handler stays a
one-liner and the firmware-mandated shape lives next to the fields it is
built from instead of being spread across `http/handlers/`. They are
intended to be pure, and all but one are: `to_device_info` shares (rather
than copies) `config["settings"]` into its result and can write a `k3Config`
key back through it — see its own docstring.

      branch. Anything else falls through to the Qiniu one.
    * `result.data` carries `token` / `bucketName` / `pathPrefix` /

      not find costs (a `strncpy` from NULL), so all six are always present.
    * The credentials are shape-correct placeholders, not secrets:
      `http/bucket.py` accepts every upload regardless of the OSS signature,
      so nothing here is checked. They are fixed rather than random so a
      response is stable and testable.
    * The outer `result.key` is the Qiniu object name and is sent for shape
      fidelity. The outer `result.token` is deliberately OMITTED: without it
      the Qiniu branch quits ("qiniu key or token is null, quit qiniu
      upload"), which is exactly the branch we do not implement.
