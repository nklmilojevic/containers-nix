# The `type` int the firmware expects in a `dev_ble_device` list entry. K3 is 0
# because it is never listed there at all (it travels inside the parent's
# device_info instead), so its value is only ever a placeholder.
#
# Two of these are evidence. 14 was read off a real W5 pairing; 24 came from a
# CTW3 owner who captured their own `dev_ble_device` list (issue #4).
#
# `w4` and `ctw2` are still assumptions, and the assumption is that a model
# shares its number with its own product line rather than with the other one:
# `ctw2` sits with `ctw3` (both cordless CT-series EverSweets), `w4` with `w5`.
# Nothing in the parent's firmware settles it — `pk_schmg_parse_ble_dev_list`
# (D4SH `ctrl`, `ble_relay_network.c`) reads `type` straight out of the JSON,
# logs `dev[%d],type:%d` and stores it, and the parent then scans by MAC. The
# value only picks which protocol it speaks once connected.
#
# A wrong guess fails silently at both ends, which is why `BLEDevice.scan_type`
# exists: the owner of the hardware can override it without a code change, the
# panel shows the exact entry that will be sent, and whatever value turns out to
# work can be brought back here as a real one — which is exactly how 24 arrived.
#
# NOT the same number as the `typeCode` in mr-ransel's protocol notes, which
# gives W5 1, W5C 2 and W5N 3. That one is the accessory's own idea of what it
# is, read over its BLE session; this one is what a PARENT is told to scan for.
