"""The constant tables the state parsers read, and the evidence behind each one.

Nothing here is a preference. Every table records something a device was
observed doing — a field that appears only while a cycle runs, the hall switches
one firmware family names, how long a cartridge lasts — and the comment above it
is the record of how that was established: a capture count, a string in `ctrl`,
an experiment run against the box. A parser is cheap to re-derive; this is not.

# A litter box has two independent deodorant consumables, and the countdown for
# both is OURS to compute: the device reports only the reset timestamps
# (`sprayResetTime`, `liquidReset`) and never a remaining count.
# `deodorantLeftDays` and `sprayLeftDays` appear in zero of 685 captured state
# reports and nowhere in the `ctrl` or `ble` binaries — they are the cloud's
# vocabulary, and here the cloud is us.
#
#   N60  the ACTIVE one: the box's own sprayer, which fires for ~2 minutes after
#        a visit. Manufacturer's replacement interval is 45 days.
#   N50  the PASSIVE one: sits in the waste bin and needs no mechanism.
#        Manufacturer's replacement interval is 30 days.
#
# Mind the vocabulary, which is inverted from the products: `deodorantLeftDays`
# is the N50 even though the N60 is the active deodorant, and `sprayLeftDays` is
# the N60. Those are pypetkitapi's cloud names, kept because they are already
# the entities' `value_path`. Do not "correct" one into the other.
#
# Why the cloud vocabulary says "spray" rather than "N60": the deodorizing
# FUNCTION is not tied to the N60. Models with no built-in unit can take an
# optional K3 (Pura Air) over BLE instead, so one field name has to cover both.
# On a T5 it is unambiguously the built-in N60 — `ctrl` holds no `k3` string at
# all and drives the sprayer off its own motor controller
# (`_pki_transmit_spray_over_event_from_mot`, `pk_hmi_get_spray_percent`), while
# `k3LightSwitch` turns up in a T4 property post and the T4 has no N60.
#
# The substitution is functional, NOT a shared data source: a K3 reports
# `battery`/`liquid` LEVELS on its parent's report (`bridge._update_linked_k3`),
# never a reset date, so these date-based countdowns cannot be fed from a K3 and
# a K3-equipped box cannot be assumed to populate them.

#: The N60's lifetime, CONFIRMED: PetKit's own cloud answers `dev_device_info`
#: with `sprayDays: 45` alongside `sprayResetTime` (captured in proxy mode), the
#: same 45 the manufacturer's replacement interval gives. It is also what
#: `payloads.to_device_info` advertises to the device, which the firmware stores
#: (`set sprayDays (%d)` in `ctrl`) — so both sites must read THIS constant and
#: neither may hardcode a number of its own. Independent literals drift, and HA
#: then burns a cartridge down on a schedule the device was never told about.
SPRAY_TOTAL_DAYS = 45

#: The N50's lifetime: the manufacturer's interval and nothing more, because the
#: field it would count from never arrives.
#:
#: The N50 has NO representation in the device protocol, established by
#: experiment on a T5 (2026-07-30). Resetting the N60 from PetKit's app sends
#: `thing.service.start {"start_action":10}`, the box answers `liquid_reset_over`
#: and its `sprayResetTime` becomes the reset moment. Resetting the N50 from the
#: app sends ONLY `thing.service.errState {"show":1,"err_state":1}` -- no start,
#: no date, no device reply, and `liquidReset` does not move. PetKit's own
#: `dev_device_info` reply carries no N50 field either: just `sprayDays`,
#: `sprayResetTime` and the `deodorantTip`/`purificationTip` notify flags. So
#: PetKit keeps the N50 replacement date in their account database and only tells
#: the box what to display.
#:
#: Consequence: `deodorantLeftDays` can never be filled from telemetry. Its
#: source `liquidReset` has been 0 in every one of 983+ captured reports and
#: nothing in any transport ever writes it. For "N50 Days Left" to read anything
#: we have to record the replacement date ourselves -- being the cloud is the
#: whole point of this add-on, and this is one of the places that has to mean it.
DEODORANT_TOTAL_DAYS = 30

#: Where a replacement date WE recorded lives, inside `Device.config`. It has to
#: be config rather than `state`: state is rebuilt from the device's next
#: contact and does not survive a restart, and for the N50 there is no next
#: contact that would ever carry it.
CONSUMABLE_RECORD_KEY = "consumables"

#: A camera feeder's desiccant pack. Like the N50 it has no countdown anywhere
#: in the protocol -- the reset is all the device knows about -- so 30 days is
#: the pack life PetKit's own app counts down from.
DESICCANT_TOTAL_DAYS = 30

#: The consumables a "replaced" action can stamp, and what each one fills.
#:
#: `apply_consumable_state` writes these into `device.state`, so a value WE
#: derived wins over one the device reported. That is right for all three:
#: each is filled from a replacement date, and the only way one gets recorded
#: is somebody pressing the button, which is newer information than whatever
#: count the device was carrying.
CONSUMABLE_TOTALS = {
    "n50": ("deodorantLeftDays", DEODORANT_TOTAL_DAYS),
    "n60": ("sprayLeftDays", SPRAY_TOTAL_DAYS),

}

#: OURS, not the device's: no work-mode code means "idle", because the device
#: says so by omitting `workState` entirely. Deliberately negative so it can
#: never collide with a real `WORK_MODES` code, and deliberately NOT added to
#: that table, which is the device's vocabulary and not ours. `sensors.py` pairs
#: it with the label; nothing else should read it as a protocol value.
WORK_MODE_IDLE = -1

#: Fields the device sends ONLY while the thing they describe is happening.
#: Presence is the whole signal — the payload never carries an "off" value, it
#: just stops appearing. Measured over 1254 captured snapshots (both
#: transports): the report is a fixed 29-key dump plus at most these extras,
#: `workState` (166), `lightState` (166) and `refreshState` (32).
#:
#: They MUST be turned into a real 0/1 here, because `device.state` is only ever
#: merged into and never pruned: a key that stops being sent keeps its last
#: value forever. `refreshState` is also an object, and a non-empty dict is
#: truthy — so the "Deodorization Running" sensor latched ON at the box's first
#: spray and stayed on for good. `lightState` is mapped too, since it has the
#: identical shape and would repeat the bug the moment anyone gives it an entity.
PRESENCE_FLAGS = {
    "refreshState": "deodorizing",

#: Proof that a payload is a whole-device snapshot rather than a fragment.
#: `litter` was present in all 1254 captured litter-box reports across both
#: transports, so its absence means we are looking at something partial (a
#: hand-built dict in a test, a device that frames its report differently) and
#: must not conclude anything from a key not being there.
SNAPSHOT_MARKER = "litter"


#: Models whose reports carry the W7H field set. A codename, NOT a payload
#: marker: `sensor` looked like one — it holds the hall block and no other
#: fountain sends it — but a live T5 carries a `sensor` block of its own
#: (`open_hall`, `dump_hall`, `prox_raw`, ...), so keying off its presence would
#: have run the fountain branch over every litter box. Both call sites already
#: know the codename; per CLAUDE.md, pass it rather than infer it.

#: W7H top-level state fields, from the reverse-engineered `property/post` map
#: supplied 2026-07-31 and present key-for-key in a real capture from the same
#: device. Copied under their own names: this IS the device's vocabulary, the
#: panel renders `device.state` verbatim, and inventing a second spelling for
#: `stgFullState` would only create something to keep in sync.
#:
#: Every one of these is a plain scalar the device sends on every report, so
#: unlike the litter box's presence-signalled trio there is no absence to read.

#:
#: Listed explicitly rather than copied by `hall_` prefix so that the set an

#:
#: Only the six `*_hall` switches are taken. `weight` duplicates `sandWeight`,
#: and `prox_raw`/`around_pos` are a raw ADC and a position code whose scale
#: and enum no source gives — publishing either would mean inventing a unit.
#:
#: Unlike the W7H's, these names have NO external map behind them, so the
#: entities carry the device's own wording rather than an interpretation of it.
#: What does corroborate them is the same device's `err{}` block, which carries
